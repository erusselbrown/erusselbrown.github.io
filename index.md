### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite lab because it was the first time that I ever wrote code.
    I was confused at first when I had to push and pull from github, but I kept
    working and asking questions until I understood how to do it. In the end, it
    was the start of my journey and I have very fond memories of it.

* Lab 4

    I am very fond of lab 4 because it was the first time that I really felt like a
    programmer. I learned how to calculate if a number was too high or too low. It
    felt like I was creating an actual program that had a use, rather than a random
    piece of software for a grade.

* Lab 2

    While lab 2 was a simple lab, I found it difficult at the time, something that I
    find humorous now. I learned how to use mathematical operations in my code. I
    didn't even realize at the time that one could simply use operations to perform
    math functions. It was a great learning experience for me.
